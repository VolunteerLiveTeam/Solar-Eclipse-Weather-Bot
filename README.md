# Solar Eclipse Weather Bot

This is the bot for the [solar eclipse live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/zersmomw72dw/). Periodically it posts weather updates.

The list of locations, as well as posting rules, are stored in an Airtable, the weather data is fetched from Dark Sky, and the bot itself runs as a [webtask](https://webtask.io).
